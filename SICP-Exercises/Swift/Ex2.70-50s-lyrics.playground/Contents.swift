//: ## Exercise 2.70
//: The following eight-symbol slaphabet with associated relative frequencies was designed to efficiently encode the lyrics of 1950s rock songs. (Note that the "symbols" of an "alphabet" need not be individual letters.)
//:
//:    A    2   GET  2   SHA  3   WAH  1
//:    BOOM 1   JOB  2   NA  16   YIP  9
//:
//: Use *generateHuffmanTree* (Exercise 2.69) to generate a corresponding Huffman tree, and use encode (Exercise 2.68) to encode the following message:
//:
//:    Get a job
//:    Sha na na na na na na na na
//:    Get a job
//:    Sha na na na na na na na na
//:    Wah yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
//:    Sha boom
//: 
//: How many bits are required for the encoding? 
//:
//: What is the smallest number of bits that would be needed to encode this song if we used a fixed-length code for the eight-symbol alphabet?
