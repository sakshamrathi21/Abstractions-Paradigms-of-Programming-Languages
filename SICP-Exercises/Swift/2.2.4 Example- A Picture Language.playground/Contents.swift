// 2.2.4 Example: A picture language

// This section presents a simle language for drawing pictures that illustrates the power of data abstraction and closure, and also exploits higher-order procedures in an essential way. The language is designed to make it easy to experiment with patterns such as the ones in Figure 2.9, which are composed of repeated elements that are shifted and scaled. In this language, the data objects being combined are represented as procedures rather than as list structure. Just as cons, which satisfies the closure property, allowed us to easily build arbitrarily complicated list structure, the operations in this language, which also satisfy the closure property, allow us to easily build arbitrarily complicated patters.

// The picture language
// When we began our study of programming in section 1.1, we emphasized the importance of describing a language by focusing on the languages primitives, its means of combination, and its means of abstraction. We'll follow that framework here.
// Part of the elegance of this picture language is that there is only one kind of element, called a painter. A painter draws an image that is shifted and scaled to fit within a designated parallelogram-shaped frame. For example, there's a primitive painter we'll call wave that makes a crude line drawing, as shown in Figure 2.10. The actual shape of the drawing depends on the frame - all four images in figure 2.10 are produced by the same wave painter, but with respect to four different frames. Painters can be more elaborate that this: The primitive painter called rogers paints a picture of MIT's found, William Barton Rogers, as shown in Figure 2.11. The four images in figure 2.11 are drawn with respect to the same four frames as the wave images in figure 2.10.
// To combine images, we use various operations that construct new painters from given painters. For example, the beside operation takes two painters and produces a new, compound painter that draws the first painter's image in the left half of the frame and the second painter's image in the right half of the frame. Similarly, below takes two painters and produces a compound painter that draws the first painter's image below the second painter's image. Somer operations transform a single painter to produce a new painter. For example, flip-vert takes a painter and produces a painter that draws its upside-down, and flip-horiz produces a painter that draws the original painter's image left-to-right reversed.
// Figure 2.12 shows the drawing of a painter called wave4 that is built up in two stages starting from wave:



func wave2(_ frame: Frame) {
    beside(wave, flipVert(wave))(frame)
}
func wave4(_ frame: Frame) {
    below(wave2, wave2)(frame)
}


draw(wave)
draw(wave2)
draw(wave4)

// In building up a complex image in this manner we are exploiting the fact that painters are closed under the language's means of combination. The beside and below of two painters is itself a painter; therefore, we can use it as an element in making more complex painters. As with building up list strucutre using cons, the closure of our data under the means of combination is crucial to the ability to create complex structures while using only a few operations.
// Once we can combine painters, we would like to be able to abstract typical patterns of combining painters. We will implement the painter operations as Scheme procedures. This means that we don't need a special abstraction mechanism in the picture language: Since the means of combination are ordinary Scheme procedures, we automatically have the capability to do anything with painter operations that we can do with procedures. For example, we can abstract the pattern in wave4 as

func flippedPairs(_ painter: @escaping Painter) -> Painter {
    let painter2 = beside(painter, flipVert(painter))
    return below(painter2, painter2)
}
draw(flippedPairs(wave))

func wave4b(_ frame: Frame) {
    flippedPairs(wave)(frame)
}
draw(wave4b)

// We can also define recursive operations. Here's one that makes painters split and branch towards the right as shown in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14

func rightSplit(_ painter: @escaping Painter, n: Int) -> Painter {
    if n == 0 {
        return painter
    } else {
        let smaller = rightSplit(painter, n: n - 1)
        return beside(painter, below(smaller, smaller))
    }
}
draw(rightSplit(wave, n: 2))

func upSplit(_ painter: @escaping Painter, n: Int) -> Painter {
    if n == 0 {
        return painter
    } else {
        let smaller = upSplit(painter, n: n - 1)
        return below(beside(smaller, smaller), painter)
    }
}

// We can produce balanced patterns by branching upwards as well as towards the right.

func cornerSplit(_ painter: @escaping Painter, n: Int) -> Painter {
    if n == 0 {
        return painter
    } else {
        let up = upSplit(painter, n: n - 1)
        let right = rightSplit(painter, n: n - 1)
        let topLeft = beside(up, up)
        let bottomRight = below(right, right)
        let corner = cornerSplit(painter, n: n - 1)
        
        return beside(below(topLeft, painter), below(corner, bottomRight))
    }
}
draw(cornerSplit(wave, n: 5))

// By placing four copies of a cornerSplit appropriately, we obtain a pattern called square-Limit, whose application to wave and rogers is shown in Figure 2.9.

func squareLimit(_ painter: @escaping Painter, n: Int) -> Painter {
    let quarter = cornerSplit(painter, n: n)
    let half = beside(flipHoriz(quarter), quarter)
    return below(half, flipVert(half))
}
draw(squareLimit(wave, n: 4))


// Higher-order Operations
// In addition to abstracting patterns of combining painters, we can work at a higher level, abstracting patterns of combining painter operations. That is, we can view the painter operations as elements to manipulate and can write means of combination for these elements - procedures that take painter operations as arguments and create new painter operations.
// For example, flippedPairs and squareLimit each arrange four copies of a painter's image in a square pattern; they differ only in how they orient the copies. One way to abstract this pattern of painter combination is with the following procedure, which takes four one-argument painter operations and produces a painter operation that transforms a given painter with those four operations and arranges the results in a square. tl, tr, bl, and br are the transformations to aply to the top left copy, the top right copy, the bottem left copy and the bottom right copy, respectively.

func squareOfFour(tl: @escaping Transformer, tr: @escaping Transformer, bl: @escaping Transformer, br: @escaping Transformer) -> Transformer {
    return { painter in
        let top = beside(tl(painter), tr(painter))
        let bottom = beside(bl(painter), br(painter))
        return below(bottom, top)
    }
}

func identity(_ painter: @escaping Painter) -> Painter {
    return painter
}

// Then flippedPairs can be defined in terms of squareOfFour as follows:

func flippedPairs2(_ painter: @escaping Painter) -> Painter {
    let combine4 = squareOfFour(tl: identity, tr: flipVert, bl: identity, br: flipVert)
    return combine4(painter)
}
draw(flippedPairs2(wave))

// and squareLimit can be expressed as

func rotate180(_ painter: @escaping Painter) -> Painter {
    return transform(painter: painter, origin: Point(x: 1, y: 1), corner1: Point(x: 0, y: 1), corner2: Point(x: 1, y: 0))
}

func squareLimit2(_ painter: @escaping Painter, n: Int) -> Painter {
    let combine4 = squareOfFour(tl:rotate180, tr:flipVert, bl:flipHoriz, br:identity)
    return combine4(cornerSplit(painter, n: n))
}
draw(squareLimit2(wave, n: 4))


// Frames
// Before we can show how to implement painters and their means of combination, we must first consider frames. A frame can be described by three vectors - an origin vector, and two edge vectors. The origin vector specifies the offset of the frame's origin from some absolute origin in the plane, and the edge vectors specify the offsets of the frame's corners from its origin. If the edges are perpendicular, the frame will be rectangluar. Otherwise the frame will be a more general parallelogram.
// Figure 2.15 shows a frame and its associated vectors. In accordance with data abstraction, we need not be specific yet about how frames are represented, other than to say that there is a constructor Frame(), which takes three vectors and produces a frame, and three corresponding selectors origin-frame, edge1-frame and edge2-frame.
// We will use coordinates in the unit square (0 <= x, y <= 1) to specify images. With each frame, we associate a frame coordinate map, which will be used to shift and scale images to fit the frame. The map transforms the unit square into the frame by mapping the vector v = (x, y) to the vector sum 

//          Origin(Frame) + x * Edge1(Frame) + y * Edge2(Frame)

// For example, (0, 0) is mapped to the origin of the frame, (1,1) to the vertex diagonally opposite the origin, and (0.5, 0.5) to the center of the frame. We can create a frame's coordinate map with the following procedure:


func frameCoordMap2(_ frame: Frame) -> (Vector) -> Vector {
    return { vector in
        return frame.origin + ((vector.x * frame.edge1) + (vector.y * frame.edge2))
    }
}

// Observe that applying frameCoordMap to a frame returns a procedure that, given a vector, returns a vector. If the argument vector is in the unit square, the result vector will be in the frame. For example

let aFrame = Frame(origin: Point(x: 1, y: 1), edge1: Vector(x: 2, y: 1.25), edge2: Vector(x: 1.5, y: 2), dc: NSImage(size: NSMakeSize(500, 500)))

frameCoordMap2(aFrame)(Vector(x: 0, y: 0))

// returns the same vector as

aFrame.origin

// or

frameCoordMap2(aFrame)(Vector(x: 0.5, y: 0.5))


// Painters
// A painter is represented as a procedure that, given a frame as argument, draws a particular image shifted and scaled to fit the frame. That is to say if p is a painter and f is a frame, then we produces p's image in f by calling p with f as argument.
// The details of how primitive painters are implemented depend on the particular characteristics of the graphics system and the type of image to be drawn. For instance, suppose we have a procedure draw-line that draws a line on the screen between two specified points. Then we can create painters for line drawings, such as the wave painter in Figure 2.10, from lists of line segments as follows:

func drawLine(_ start: Point, _ end: Point) {
    print("Draw Line from \(start.x),\(start.y) to \(end.x),\(end.y)")
}

func segmentsToPainter2(_ segments: [Segment]) -> Painter {
    return { frame in
        for segment in segments {
            let start = frameCoordMap2(frame)(segment.startPoint)
            let end = frameCoordMap2(frame)(segment.endPoint)
            drawLine(start, end)
        }
    }
}

// The segments are given using coordinates with respect to the unitsquare. For each segment in the list, the painter transforms the segment end-points with the frame coordinate map and draws a line between the transformed points.
// Representing painters as procedures erects a powerful abstraction barrier in the picture language. We can create and intermix all sorts of primitive painters, based on a variety of graphics capabilities. The details of their implementation do not matter. Any procedure can serve as a painter, provided that it takes a frame as argument and draws somthing scaked to fit the frame.


// Transforming and combining painters
// An operation on painters (such as flipVert or beside) works by creating a painter that invokes the original painters with respect to frames derived from the argument frame. Thus, for example, flipVert doesn't have to know how a painter works in order to flip it - it just has to know how to turn a frame upside down: The flipped painter just uses the original painter, but in the inverted frame.
// Painter operations are based on the procedure transformPainter, which takes as arguments a painter and information on how to transform a frame and produces a new painter. The transformed painter, when called on a frame, transforms the frame and calls the original painter on the transformed frame. The arguments to transformPainter are points (represented as vectors) that specify the corners of the new frame: When mapped into the frame, the first point specifies the new frame's origin and the other two specify the ends fo its edge vectors. Thus, arguments within the unit square specify a frame contained within the original frame.

// The function below crashes if it is uncommented. I think it has to do with the frames dc property. This is a drawing context which is just an NSImage. Seems to work fine when it is hidden in the draw() function in Sources but causes issues if I try to access it directly in the playground.

public func transformPainter(painter: Painter, origin: Point, corner1: Point, corner2: Point) -> Painter {
    return { frame in
        let m = frameCoordMap(frame)
        let newOrigin = m(origin)
        painter(Frame(origin: newOrigin, edge1: m(corner1) - newOrigin, edge2: m(corner2) - newOrigin, dc: frame.dc))
    }
}
*/

// Here's how to flip painter images vertically:

func flipVert2(_ painter: @escaping Painter) -> Painter {
    return transform(painter: painter, origin: Point(x: 0, y: 1), corner1: Point(x: 1, y: 1), corner2: Point(x: 0, y: 0))
}
draw(flipVert2(wave))

// Other transformations rotate images counterclockwise by 90 degrees

func rotate90(_ painter: @escaping Painter) -> Painter {
    return transform(painter: painter, origin: Point(x: 1, y: 0), corner1: Point(x: 1, y: 1), corner2: Point(x: 0, y: 0))
}
draw(rotate90(wave))

// or squash images towards the center of the frame:

func squashInwards(_ painter: @escaping Painter) -> Painter {
    return transform(painter: painter, origin: Point(x: 0.35, y: 0.35), corner1: Point(x: 0.65, y: 0.35), corner2: Point(x: 0.35, y: 0.65))
}
draw(squashInwards(wave))

// Frame transformation is also the key to defining means of combining two or more painters. The beside procedure, for example, takes two painters, transforms them to paint in the left and right halves of an argument frame respectively, and produces a new, compound painter.
// When the compound painter is given a frame, it calls the first transformed painter to paint in the left half of the frame and calls the second transformed painter to paint in the right half of the frame:
/*
func beside2(painter1: Painter, painter2: Painter) -> Painter {
    let splitPoint = Point(x: 0.5, y: 0)
    let paintLeft = transformPainter(painter1, Point(x: 0, y: 0), splitPoint, Point(x: 0, y: 1))
    let paintRight = transformPainter(painter2, splitPoint, Point(x: 1, y: 0), Point(x: 0.5, y: 1))
    return { frame in
        paintLeft(frame)
        paintRight(frame)
    }
}
*/

func besidePainter(_ frame: Frame) {
    beside(wave, wave)(frame)
}
draw(besidePainter)


// Observe how the painter data abstraction, and in particular the represetation of painters as procedures, makes beside easy to implement. The beside procedure need not know anything about the details of the component painters other than that each painter will draw something in its designated frame.
