//: # Exercise 2.57
// Extend the differentiation program to handle sums and products of arbitrary numbers of (two or more) terms. Then the last example above could be expressed as
// 
//     deriv(* "x" "y" (+ "x" 3), "x")
//
// Hmmm, I had already jumped to infix notation so I don't know what to do for this problem. WIll jump straight to 2.58 as it implies that my existing solution doesn't really take care of operator precedence at the moment.
