\ Exercise 1.4 Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations
\              whose operators are compond expressions. Use this observation
\              to describe the behaviour of the following procedure.

\ Exercise 1.5 Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter
\              he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order
\              evaluation. He defines the following two procedures
\ I don't think this is going to work for FORTH as I don't know how to pass

\ Example 1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method
\ Functions are declarative knowledge and procedures are imperative knowledge.
\ Meaning that functions describe functions of things and procedures describe
\ how to do things.

\ How does one compute square roots?
\ Guess a value, y, for the value of the square root of a number x. Find the
\ quotient of x divided by the guess. Average the quotient and the guess.
\ Continue till you have an accurate enough answer.
