; Exercise 1.4 Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations 
;              whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation 
;              to describe the behaviour of the following procedure.
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
(a-plus-abs-b 4 5)
(a-plus-abs-b 4 -5)
; In the procedure above the operator used for combining the values of a and 
; b is choosen at runtime based on the evaluation of the computation of 
; whether b is positive or negative.


; Exercise 1.5 Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter
;              he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order 
;              evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
; Then he evaluates the expression
;(test 0 (p))

;              What behaviour will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses 
;              applicative-order evaluation?
; (test 0 (p))
; (test 0 (p))
; (test 0 (p))
; (test 0 (p))
; 
; Infinite loop. The (p) is repeditively expanded to itself.

;              What behaviour will he observe with an interpreter that uses 
;              normal-order evaluation?
; (test 0 (p))
; (if (= x 0) 0 y))
; (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)))
; (if #t 0 (p)))
; 0
; Result is 0. The procedure is evaluated step by step to get the result.


; 1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method
; Functions are declarative knowledge and procedures are imperative knowledge.
; Meaning that functions describe functions of things and procedures describe
; how to do things.

; How does one compute square roots?
; Guess a value, y, for the value of the square root of a number x. Find the
; quotient of x divided by the guess. Average the quotient and the guess.
; Continue till you have an accurate enough answer.

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)

      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))

; Exercise 1.6 Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as
; a special form. "Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in 
; terms pf cond?" she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Actor claims this can 
; indeed be done and she defines a new version of if:
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause) 
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
      (else else-clause)))

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
; Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:
(define (new-sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (new-sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                        x)))
(define (new-sqrt x) (new-sqrt-iter 1 x))
;(new-sqrt 9)
; If we run the line above the interpreter loops forever. The if statement
; is a special form that evaluates the predicate and then evaluates one,
; but not both of the consequant or alternative. new-if on the other hand
; is a procedure so the predicate, consequant and alternative are all evaluated
; before going to the next step. At this point new-sqrt-iter is evaluated again
; which leads to the infinite loop.


; Exercise 1.7 The good-enough? test used in computing square roots will not 
; be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, 
; in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with 
; limited precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. 
; Explain these statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small 
; and large numbers.

; (define (good-enough? guess x)
;  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

; Small numbers
; Our good enough function uses a fixed difference value of 0.001 to determine
; if the guess is good enough no matter what the value of x we are using is. If
; x is small then the square of the guess being within 0.001 of x is not a very 
; good indication that the guess shoudl be accepted.
; As an example the sqrt of 0.001 is 0.0316. However guesses in the range 0 to
; 0.0447 will be accepted as good enough
(good-enough? 0.00001 0.001)
(good-enough? 0.0447 0.001)
(sqrt 0.001)

; Large numbers

(sqrt 1000000000000) ; Evaluates quickly
;(sqrt 10000000000000) ; Evaluates slowly

; An alternative strategy for implementing  good-enough? is to watch how guess 
; changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very 
; small fraction of the guess. Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind 
; of end test. Does this work better for small and large numbers?

; Yes it does work better for small and large numbers.


; Exercise 1.8 Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y 
; is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is
; given by the value
; x/y ^2 + 2y 
; -----------
;      3
; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the 
; square-root procedure.
