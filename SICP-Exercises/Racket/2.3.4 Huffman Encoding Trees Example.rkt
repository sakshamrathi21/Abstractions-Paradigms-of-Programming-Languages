; Example: Huffman Encoding Trees
; This section provides practice in the use of list structure and data abstraction to manipulat
; sets and trees. The application is to methods for representing data as sequences of ones and
; zeros (bits). For example the ASCII standard code used to represent text in computers encodes
; each character as a sequence of seven bits. Using seven bits allows us to distinguish 2^7, or
; 128, possible different characters. In general, if we want to distinguish n different symbols
; we will need to use log2n bits per symbol. If all our messages are made up of the eight symbols
; A,B,C,D,E,F,G and H, we can choose a code with three bits per character, for example
;
;    A 000    C 010    E 100    G 110
;    B 001    D 011    F 101    H 111
;
; With thie code, the message
;
;    BACADAEAFABBAAAGAAH
;
; is encoded as the string of 54 bits
;
;    001000010000011000100000101000001001000000000110000111
;
; Codes such as ASCII and the A-through-H code above are known as fixed-length codes, because
; they represent each symbol in the message with the same number of bits. It is sometimes 
; adventageous to use variable-length codes, in which different symbols may be represented by 
; different numbers of bits. For example, Morse code does not use the same number of dots and
; dashes for each letter of the alphabet. In particular, E, the most frequent letter, is represented 
; by a single dot. In general, if our messages are such that some symbols appear very frequently
; and some very rarely, we can encode data more efficiently (i.e., using fewer bits per message)
; if we assign shorter codes to the frequent symbols. Consider the following alternative code
; for the letters A through H:
;
;    A 0       C 1010    E 1100    G 1110
;    B 100     D 1011    F 1101    G 1111
; 
; With this code, the same message as above is encoded as the string
;
;    100010100101101100011010100100000111001111
;
; This string contains 42 bits, so it saves more than 20% in space in comparison with the 
; fixed-length code shown above. 

; One of the difficulties of using variable-length code is knowing when you have reached the
; end of a symbol in reading a sequence of zeros and ones. Morse code solves this problem by
; using a special seperator code (in this case, a pause) after the sequence of dots and dashes
; for each letter. Another solution is to design the code in such a way that no complete code
; for any symbol is the beginning (or prefix) of the code for another symbol. Such a code
; is called a prefix code. In the example above, A is encoded by 0 and B is encoded by 100,
; so no other symbol can have a code that begins with 0 or with 100.

; In general, we can attain significant savings if we use variable-length prefix codes that
; take advantage of the relative frequencies of the symbols in the messages to be encoded. One
; particular scheme for doing this is called the Huffman encoding method, after its discoverer,
; David Huffman. A Huffman code can be represented as a binary tree whose leaves are the symbols
; that are encoded. At each non-leaf node of the tree there is a set containing all the symbols
; in the leaves that lie below the node. In addition, each symbol at a lead is assigned a weight
; (which is its relative frequency), and each non-leaf node contains a weight that is the sum of 
; all the weights of the leaves lying below it. The weights are not used in the encoding or the
; decoding process. We will see below how they are used to help construct the tree.

; Figure 2.18 shows the Huffman tree for the A-through-H code given above. The weights at the
; leaves indicate that the tree was designed for messages in which A appears with relative
; frequence 8, B with relative frequency 3, and the other letters each with relative frequency
; 1.

; Given a Huffman tree, we can find the encoding of any symbol by starting at the root and moving 
; down until we reach the leaf that holds the symbol. Each time we move down a left branch we
; add a 0 to the code, and each time we move we move down a right branch we add a 1. (We decide
; which branch to follow by testing to see which branch either is the leaf node for the symbol
; or contains the symbol in its set.) For example. starting from the root of the tree in Figure
; 2.18, we arrive at the leaf for D by following a right branch, then a left branch, then a right
; branch, then a right branch; hence, the code for D is 1011.

; To decode a bit sequence using a Huffman tree, we begin at the root and use the successive
; zeros and nes of the bit sequence to determine whether to move down the left or the right branch.
; Each time we come to a leaf, we have generated a new symbol in the message, at which point we
; start over from the root of the tree to find the next symbol. For example, suppose we are given 
; the tree above and the sequence 10001010. Starting at the root, we move down the right branch, 
; (since the first bit of the string is 1), then down the left branch (since the second bit is
; 0), then down the left branch (since the third bit is also 0). This brings us to the leaf for
; B, so the first symbol of the decoded message is B. Now we start again at the root, and we
; make a left move because the next bit in the string is 0. This brings us to the leaf for A.
; Then we start again at the root with the rest of the string 1010, so we move right, left, right
; left and reach C. Thus, the entire message is BAC.

; Generating Huffman trees
; Given an "alphabet" of symbols and their relative frequencies, how do we construct the "best" 
; code? (In other words, which tree will encode messages with the fewest bits?) Huffman gave an
; algorithm for doing this and showed that the resulting code is indeed the best variable-length
; code for messages where the relative frequency fo the symbols matches the frequencies with which 
; the code was constructed. We will not prove this optimality of Huffman codes here, but we will
; show how Huffman trees are constructed.

; The algorithm for generating a Huffman tree is very simple. The idea is to arrange the tree
; so that the symbols with the lowest frequency appear farthest away from the root. Begin with
; the set of leaf nodes, constaining symbols and their frequencies, as determined by the initial
; data from which the code is to be constructed. Now find two leaves with the lowest weights and
; merge them to produce a node that has these two nodes as its left and right branches. The weight
; of the new node is the sum of the two weights. Remove the two leaves from the original set and 
; replace them by this new node. Now continue this process. At each step, merge two nodes with
; the smallest weights, removing them from the set and replacing them with a node that has these
; two as its left and right branches. The process stops when there is only one node left, which
; is the root of the entire tree. Here is how the Huffman tree of Figure 2.18 was generated
;
; Initial leaves  {(A 8) (B 3) (C 1) (D 1) (E 1) (F 1) (G 1) (H 1)}
;          Merge  {(A 8) (B 3) ({C D} 2) (E 1) (F 1) (G 1) (H 1)}
;          Merge  {(A 8) (B 3) ({C D} 2) ({E F} 2) (G 1) (H 1)}
;          Merge  {(A 8) (B 3) ({C D} 2) ({E F} 2) ({G H} 2)}
;          Merge  {(A 8) (B 3) ({C D} 2) ({E F G H} 4)}
;          Merge  {(A 8) ({B C D} 5) ({E F G H} 4)}
;          Merge  {(A 8) ({B C D E F G H} 9)}
;    Final Merge  {({A B C D E F G H} 17)}

; The algorithm does not always specify a unique tree, because there may not be unique smallest-
; weight nodes at each step. Also, the choice of the order in which the two nodes are merged
; (i.e., which will be the right branch and which will be the left branch) is arbitrary.


; Representing Huffman trees
; In the exercises below we will work with a system that uses Huffman trees to encode and
; decode messages and generates Huffman trees according to the algorithm outlined above. We will
; begin by discussion how trees are represented.

; Leaves of the tree are represented by a list consisting of the symbol leaf, the symbol at the 
; leaf, and the weight:

(define (make-leaf symbol weight) (list 'leaf symbol weight))
(define (leaf? object) (eq? (car object) 'leaf)) ; ??? Typo in the book here
(define (symbol-leaf x) (cadr x))
(define (weight-leaf x) (caddr x))

; A general tree will be a list of a left branch, a right branch, a set of symbols, and a weight.
; The set of symbols will be simply a list of the symbols, rather than some more sophisticated
; set representation. When we make a tree by merging two nodes, we obtain the weight of the tree
; as the sum of the weights of the nodes. Since our symbol sets are represented as lists, we can
; form the union by using the append procedure we defined in Section 2.2.1:

(define (left-branch tree) (car tree))
(define (right-branch tree) (cadr tree))
(define (symbols tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      (list (symbol-leaf tree))
      (caddr tree)))
(define (weight tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      (weight-leaf tree)
      (cadddr tree)))

(define (make-code-tree left right)
  (list left
        right
        (append (symbols left) (symbols right))
        (+ (weight left) (weight right))))

; The procedures symbol and weight must do something slightly different depending on whether
; they are called with a lead or a general tree. These are simple examples of generic procedures
; (procedures that can handle more than one kind of data), which we will have much more to say
; about in Section 2.4 and Section 2.5.


; The decoding procedure
; The following procedure implements the decoding algorithm. It takes as arguments a list of
; zeros and ones, together with a Huffman tree.

(define (choose-branch bit branch)
  (cond ((= bit 0) (left-branch branch))
        ((= bit 1) (right-branch branch))
        (else (error "bad bit: CHOOSE-BRANCH" bit))))

(define (decode bits tree)
  (define (decode-1 bits current-branch)
    (if (null? bits)
        '()
        (let ((next-branch
               (choose-branch (car bits) current-branch)))
          (if (leaf? next-branch)
              (cons (symbol-leaf next-branch)
                    (decode-1 (cdr bits) tree))
              (decode-1 (cdr bits) next-branch)))))
  (decode-1 bits tree))

; The procedure decode-1 takes two arguments: the list of remaining bits and the current position
; in the tree. It keeps moving "down" the tree, choosing a left or a right branch according to 
; whether the next bit in the list is a zero or a one. (This is done with the procedure 
; choose-branch). When it reaches a lead, it returns the symbol at that leaf as the next symbol 
; in the message by consing it onto the result of decoding the rest of the message, starting at 
; the root of the tree. Note the eroor check in the final clause of choose-branch, which 
; complains if the procedure finds something other than a zero or a one in the input data.


; Sets of weighted elements
; In our representation of tress, each non-leaf node contains a set of symbols, which we have
; represented as a simple list. However, the tree generating algorithm discussed above requires
; that we also work with sets of leaves and trees, successively merging the two smallest items.
; Since we will be required to repeatedly find the smallest item in a set, if is convenient to
; use an ordered representation for this kind of set.

; We will represent a set of leaves and trees as a lis of elements, arranged in increasing order
; of weight. The following adjon-set procedure for constructing sets is similar to the one 
; described in Exercise 2.61; however, items are compared by their weights, and the element
; being added to the set is never already in it.

(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (cond ((null? set) (list x))
        ((< (weight x) (weight (car set))) (cons x set))
        (else (cons (car set)
                    (adjoin-set x (cdr set))))))

; The following procedure takes a list of symbol-frequency pairs such as ((A 4) (B 2) (C 1) (D 1))
; and constructs an initial ordered set of leaves, ready to be merged according to the Huffman
; algorithm:

(define (make-leaf-set pairs)
  (if (null? pairs)
      '()
      (let ((pair (car pairs)))
        (adjoin-set (make-leaf (car pair)   ; symbol
                               (cadr pair)) ; frequency
                    (make-leaf-set (cdr pairs))))))
