; Systems with Generic Operations

; In the previous section, we saw how to design systems in which data objects
; can be represented in more than one way. The key idea is to link the code
; that specifies the data operations to the several representations by means
; of generic interface procedures. Now we will see how to use this same idea
; not only to define operations that are generic over different representations
; but also to define operations that are generic over different kinds of
; arguments. We have already seen several different packages of arithmetic
; operations: the primitive arithmetic (+, -, *, /) built into our language,
; the rational-number arithmetic (add-rat, sub-rat, mul-rat, div-rat) of
; section 2.1.1, and the complec-number arithmetic that we implemented in
; section 2.4.3. We will now use data-directed techniques to construct a
; package of arithmetic operations that incorporates all the arithmetic
; packages we have already constructed.
;
; Figure 2.23 shows the structure of the system we shal build. Notice the
; abstraction barriers. From the perspective of someone using "numbers", there
; is a single procedure add that operates on whatever numbers are supplied.
; add is part of a generic interface that allows the separate ordinary-arithmetic,
; rational-arithmetic, and complex-arithmetic packages to be accessed uniformly
; by programs that use numbers. Any individual arithmetic package (such as
; the complex package) may itself be accessed through generic procedures (such
; as add-complex) that combine packages designed for different representations
; (such as rectangular and polar). Moreover, the structure of the system is
; additive, so that one can design the individual arithmetic packages separately
; and combine them to produce a generic arithmetic system.

; 2.5.1 Generic Arithmetic Operations
; The task of designing generic arithmetic operations is analogous to that
; of designing the generic complex-number operations. We would like, for
; instance, to have a generic addition procedure add that acts like ordinary
; primitive addition + on ordinary numbers, like add-rat on rational numbers,
; and like add-complex on complex numbers. We can implement add, and the
; other generic arithmetic operations, by following the same strategy we
; used in Section 2.4.3 to implement generic selectors for complex numbers.
; We will attach a type tag to each kind of number and cause the generic
; procedure to dispatch to an appropriate package according to the data
; type of its arguments.

; The generic arithmetic procedures are defined as follows:

(define (add x y) (apply-generic 'add x y))
(define (sub x y) (apply-generic 'sub x y))
(define (mul x y) (apply-generic 'mul x y))
(define (div x y) (apply-generic 'div x y))

; We begin by installing a package for handling ordinary numbers, that is,
; the primitive numbers of our language. We will tag these with the symbol
; scheme-number. The arithmetic operations in this package are the primitive
; arithmetic procedures (so there is no need to define extra procedures to
; handle the untagged numbers). Since these operations each take two arguments,
; they are installed in the table keyed by the list
; (scheme-number scheme-number):

(define global-array '())

(define (make-entry k v) (list k v))
(define (key entry) (car entry))
(define (value entry) (cadr entry))

(define (put op type item)
  (define (put-helper k array)
    (cond ((null? array) (list(make-entry k item)))
          ((equal? (key (car array)) k) array)
          (else (cons (car array) (put-helper k (cdr array))))))
  (set! global-array (put-helper (list op type) global-array)))

(define (get op type)
  (define (get-helper k array)
    (cond ((null? array) #f)
          ((equal? (key (car array)) k) (value (car array)))
          (else (get-helper k (cdr array)))))
  (get-helper (list op type) global-array))

; What we have here is a two-level tag system. A typical complex number, such
; as 3 + 4i in rectangular form, would be represented as shown in Figure 2.24.
; The outer tag (complex) is used to direct the number to the complex package.
; Once within the complex package, the next tag (rectangular) is used to direct
; the number to the rectangular package. In a large and complicated system
; there might be many levels, each interfaced with the next by means of generic
; operations. As a data object is passed "downward," the outer tag that is used
; to direct it to the appropriate package is stripped off (by applying contents)
; and the next level of tag (if any) becomes visible to be used for further
; dispatching.

; In the above packages, we used add-rat, add-complex, and the other arithmetic
; procedures exactly as originally written. Once these definitions are internal
; to different installation procedures, however. they no longer need names that
; are distinct from each other: we could simply name them add, sub, mul, and
; div in both packages.


; 2.5.2 Combining Data of Different Types
; We have seen how to define a unified arithmetic system that encompasses ordinary
; numbers, complex numbers, rational numbers, and any other type of number we
; might decide to invent, but we have ignored an important issue. The operations
; we have defined so far treat the different data types as being completely
; independent. Thus, there are separate packages for adding, say, two ordinary
; numbers, or two complex numbers. What we have not yet considered is the fact that
; it is meaningful to define operations that cross the type boundaries, such as the
; addition of a complex number to an ordinary number. We have gone to great pains
; to introduce barriers between parts of our programs so that they can be developed
; and understood separately. We would like to introduce the cross-type operations
; in some carefully controlled way, so that we can support them without seriously
; violating our module boundaries.

; One way to handle cross-type operations is to design a different procedure for
; each possible combination of types for which the operation is valid. For example,
; we could extend the complex-number package so that it provides a procedure for
; adding complex numbers to ordinary numbers and installs this in the table using
; the tag (complex scheme-number):

;; To be included in the complex package
;(define (add-complex-to-schemnum z x)
;  (make-from-real-imag (+ (real-part z) x) (imag-part z)))
;(put 'add '(complex scheme-number)
;     (lambda (z x) (tag (add-complex-to-schemenum z x))))

; This technique works, but it is combersome. With such a system, the cost of
; introducing a new type is not just the construction of the package of procedures
; for that type but also the construction and installation of the procedures that
; implement the cross-type operations. This can easily be much more code than is needed
; to define the operations on the type itself. The method also undermines our ability
; to combine separate packages additively, or at least to limit the extent to which
; the implementors of the individual packages need to take account of other
; packages. For instance, in the example above, it seems reasonable that handling
; mixed operations on complex numbers and ordinary numbers should be the responsibility
; of the complex-number package. Combining rational numbers and complex numnbers,
; however, might be done by the complex package, the rational package, or by some
; third package that uses operations extracted from these two packages. Formulation
; coherent policies on the divisioin of responsibility among packages can be an
; overwhelming task in designing systems with many packages and many cross-type
; operations


; Coercion
; In the general situation of completely unrelated operations acting on completely
; unrelated types, implementing explicit cross-type operations, cumbersome though
; it may be, is the best that one can hope for. Fortunately, we can usually do better
; by taking advantage of additional structure that may be latent in our type system.
; Often the different data types are not completely independent, and there may be ways
; by which objects of one type may be viewed as being of another type. This process
; is called coersion. For example, if we are asked to arithmetically combine an
; ordinary number with a complex number, we can view the ordinary number as a complex
; number whose imaginary part is zero. This transforms the problem to that of combining
; two complex numbers, which can be handled in the ordinary way by the complex-arithmetic
; package.

; In general, we can implement this idea by designing coersion procedures that transoform
; an object of one type into an equivalent object of another type. Here is a typical
; coersion procedure, which transforms a given ordinary number to a complex number with
; that real part and zero imaginary part:

(define (scheme-number->complex n)
  (make-complex-from-real-imag (contents n) 0))

(scheme-number->complex (make-scheme-number 5))

; We install these coercion procedures in a special coercion table, indexed under the
; names of the two types:

(define (put-coercion t1 t2 func)
  (+ 1 1))
(define (get-coercion t1 t2)
  (lambda (a b) (+ 1 1)))

(put-coercion 'scheme-number
              'complex
              scheme-number->complex)

; (We assume that there are put-coercion and get-coercion procedures available for
; manipulating this table.) Generally some of the slots in the table will be empty,
; because it is not generally possible to coerce an arbitrary data object of each type
; to all other types. For example, there is no way to coerce an arbitrary complex number
; to an ordinary number, so there will be no general complex->scheme-number procedure
; included in the table.

; Once the coercion table has been set up, we can handle coercion in a uniform manner
; by modifying the apply-generic procedure of Section 2.4.3. When asked to apply an
; operation, we first check whether the operation is defined for the arguments' types,
; just as before. If so, we diespatch to the procedure found in the operation-and-type
; table. Otherwise, we try coercion. For simplicity, we consider only the case where
; there are two arguments. We check the coercion table to see if objects of the first
; type can be coerced ot the second type. If so, we coerce the first argument and try
; the operation again. If objects of the first type cannot in general be coerced to the
; second type, we try the coercion the other way around to see if there is a way to
; coerce the second argument to the type of the first argument. Finally, if there is
; no known way to coerce either type to the other type, we give up. Here is the
; procedure:

(define (apply-generic2 op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents args))
          (if (= (length args) 2)
              (let ((type1 (car type-tags))
                    (type2 (cadr type-tags))
                    (a1 (car args))
                    (a2 (cadr args)))
                (let ((t1->t2 (get-coercion type1 type2))
                      (t2->t1 (get-coercion type2 type1)))
                  (cond (t1->t2
                         (apply-generic op (t1->t2 a1) a2))
                        (t2->t1
                         (apply-generic op a1 (t1->t2 a2)))
                        (else (error "No method for these types"
                                     (list op type-tags))))))
              (error "No method for these types" (list op type-tags)))))))

; This coercion scheme has many advantages over the method of defining explicit
; cross-type operations as outlined above. Although we still need to write coercion
; procedures to relate the types (possibly n^2 proceduresfor a system with n types)
; we need to write only one procedure for each pair of types rather than a different
; procedure for each collection of types and each generic operation. What we are
; counting on here is the fact that the appropriate transformation between types
; depends only on the types themselves, not on the operation to be applied.

; On the other hand, there may be applications for which our coercion scheme is not
; general enough. Even when neither of the objects to be combined can be converted
; to the type of the other it may still be possible to perform the operation by
; converting both objects to a third type. In order to deal with such complexity and
; still preserve modularity in our programs, it is usually necessary to build
; systems that take advantage of still further structure in the relations among
; types, as we discuss next.


; Hierarchies of types
; The coercion scheme presented above relied on the existence of natural relations
; between pairs of types. Often there is more "global" structure in how the different
; types relate to each other. For instance, suppose we are building a generic
; arithmetic system to handle integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex
; numbers. In such a system, it is quite natural to regard an integer as a special
; kind of rational number, which is in turn a special kind of real number, which is
; in turn a special kind of complex number. What we actually have is a so-called
; hierarchy of types, in which, for example, integers are a subtype of rational
; numbers (i.e., any operation that can be applied to a rational number can
; automatically be applied to an integer). Conversely, we say that rational numbers
; form a supertype of integers. The particular hierarchy we have here is of a very
; simple kind, in which each type has at most one supertype and at most one subtype.
; Such a structure, called a tower, is illustrated in Figure 2.25.

;                complex
;                   ^
;                   |
;                 real
;                   ^
;                   |
;                rational
;                   ^
;                   |
;                integer
;
; Figure 2.25: A tower of types

; If we have a tower structure, then we can greatly simplify the problem of adding
; a new type to the hierarchy, for we need only specify how the new type is embedded
; in the next supertype above it and how it is the supertype of the type below it. For
; example. if we want to add an integer to a complex number, we need not explicitly
; define a special coercion procedure integer->complex. Instead, we define how an integer
; can be transformed into a real number, and how a real number is transformed into a
; complex number. We then allow the system to transform the integer into a complex
; number through these steps and then add the two complex numbers.

; We can redesign our apply-generic procedure in the following way: For each type, we
; need to supply a raise procedure, which  "raises" objects of that type one level in
; the tower. (Exercise 2.83 and Exercise 2.84 concern the details of implementing such
; a strategy.)

; Another advantage of a tower is that we can easily implement the notion that every
; type "inherits" all operations defined on a supertype. For instance, if we do not
; supply a special procedure for finding the real part of an integer, we should
; nevertheless expect that real-part will be defined for integers by virtue of the fact
; that integers are a subtype of complex numbers. In a tower, we can arrange for this
; to happen in a unidform way by modifying apply-generic. If the required operation is
; not directly defined for the type of the object given, we raise the object to its
; supertype and try again. We thus crawl up the tower, transforming our argument as
; we go, until we either find a level at which the desired operation can be performed
; or hit the top (in which case we give up).

; Yet another advantage of a tower over a more general hierachy is that it gives us a
; simple way to "lower" a data object to the simplest representation. For example, if we
; add 2 + 3i to 4 - 3i, it would be nice to obtain the answer as the integer 6 rather
; than as the complex number 6 + 0i.Exercise 2.85 discusses a way to implement such a
; lowering operation (The trick is that we need a general way to distinguish those objects
; that can be lowered, such as 6 + 0i, from those that cannot, such as 6 + 2i.)


; Inadaquacies of hierarchies
; If the data types in our system can be naturally arranged in a tower, this greatly
; simplifies the problems of dealing with generic operations on different types, as we
; have seen. Unfortunately, this is usually not the case. Figure 2.26 illustrates a
; more complex arrangement of mixed types, this one showing relations among different
; types of geometric figures. We see that, in general, a type may have more than one
; subtype.Triangles and quadrilaterals, for instance, are both subtypes of polygons.
; In addition, a type may have more than one supertype. For example, an isosceles right
; angle triangle may be regarded either as an isosceles triangle or as a right angle
; triangle. This multiple-supertypes issue is particularly thorny, since it means that
; there is no unique way to "raise" a type in the hierarchy. Finding the "correct"
; supertype in which to apply an operation to an object may involve considerable
; searching through the entire type network on the part of a procedure such as
; apply-generic. Since there generally are multiple subtypes for a type, there is a
; similar problem in coercing a value "down" the type hierarchy. Dealing with large
; numbers of interrelated types while still preserving modularity in the design of
; large systems is very difficult, and is an area of much current research.
