; Exercise 2.51
; Define the below operation for painters. below takes two painters as arguments. The 
; resulting painter, given a frame, draws with the first painter in the bottom of the
; frame and with the second painter in the top. Define below in two different ways - 
; first by writing a procedure that is analogous to the beside procedure given above,
; and again in terms of beside and suitable rotation operations (from exercise 2.50).
