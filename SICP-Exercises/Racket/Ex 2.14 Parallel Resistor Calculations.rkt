; Exercise 2.14
; Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a variety 
; of arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals A and B, and use them in computing 
; the expressions A/A and A/B. You will get the most insight by using intervals whose 
; width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine the results of the computation 
; in center-percent form (see exercise 2.12).
